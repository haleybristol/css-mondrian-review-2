# Mondrian Design Layout

#### By Haley Bristol

## Description

This webpage is a replication of the styles used on the Andersson-Wise website home page. The design is based off the Mondrian Style Layout. There are three breakpoints in which the layout is responsive. Relative units are used when appropriate. The site does not use bootstrap or any front-end framework. Images are somewhat fluid.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Git Clone!!

## Known Bugs
